# The hard stuff
I am a Computational Condensed Matter physicist turned Quant Finance Trading Developer, pursuing an exciting career through the world of low latency and mathematical modeling of noisy market data.

During my [successful](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oAp2Siow_v8C) stint in Academia, where I achieved a PhD and currently hold a Post-Doctoral position, I got more and more passionate about the software engineering side of things.
This led me to jump head-first into the - at the time (2016) - relatively young [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. I absolutely love the balance it strikes between elegance and performance making the development of [a bunch](https://github.com/louisponet?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=julia&sort=stargazers) of open-source projects a real joy.

The final impetus for my shift towards the financial markets was an enlightening collaboration with [flovtec](https://www.flovtec.com/), where I got the opportunity to develop a proof-of-concept market data ingestion engine in `rust`.
I've always been a fan of exciting new technologies and had been wanting to learn it for a while, so it was a no-brainer: I could get a glimpse of real-life quant finance and learn `rust`.

This invaluable experience opened the doors to my next position as trading developer/market data specialist at [Bitcoin Suisse](https://bitcoinsuisse.com/), one of the leading crypto investment partners.
There, I have been rebuilding the market data ingestion systems completely from-the-ground up, focusing on robustness and latency minimization. The languages of choice are, you guessed it, `c++` and `rust`... Perfect.
As a bonus, I also got a good baptism by fire on `c#` since it comprises most of the preexisting codebase.

In my off-time, I have kept developing my low-latency trading engine [**Mantra**](@/posts/hello_world/index.md), and I keep one foot in Academia by publishing the odd paper on condensed matter physics.

# The soft stuff
Sometimes, I have time left for hobbies which I thoroughly enjoy:
- Skiing
- Kite Surfing
- Tennis
- Mountain Biking
- Gastronomical experiences
- A calm stroll through nature
